            <section>The creation of black holes is a fascinating process that occurs as a result of the evolution of massive stars. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how black holes are created:</section>
            <h1>Formation of Massive Stars:</h1>
            <p>Black holes are primarily formed from massive stars, typically those with a mass many times greater than that of our Sun. These stars have a much more intense gravitational pull due to their mass.</p>
            <h1>Nuclear Fusion:</h1>
            <p> Massive stars, like our Sun, spend most of their lives undergoing nuclear fusion. In the core of the star, hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium through a series of nuclear reactions. This process releases an enormous amount of energy, which counteracts the gravitational force trying to collapse the star.</p>
            <h1>Helium and Heavy Element Fusion:</h1>
            <p>As the star ages, it continues to fuse helium into heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, and eventually iron. These fusion processes create energy that balances the gravitational forces trying to compress the star.</p>
            <h1>Supernova Explosion:</h1>
            <p>The core collapse triggers an explosive event known as a supernova. This explosion is one of the most energetic events in the universe, releasing an immense amount of energy and blasting the outer layers of the star into space.</p>
