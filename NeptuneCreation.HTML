        <h1>The formation of Neptune, like the other planets in our solar system, is a complex process that occurred about 4.5 billion years ago as part of the solar system's formation. It is thought to have formed through a series of stages, which scientists have developed theories about based on observations, computer simulations, and the study of other planetary systems. Here's an overview of the most widely accepted theory for Neptune's formation:</h1>
        <ol>
        <li>Solar Nebula: The process began within a giant molecular cloud, a region of space with a high concentration of gas and dust. This cloud is often referred to as the solar nebula. Within the solar nebula, tiny solid particles, or dust grains, clumped together due to mutual gravitational attraction.</li>
        <li>Protoplanetary Disk: As dust particles collided and stuck together, they formed larger and larger clumps, known as planetesimals. These planetesimals further collided and merged to create even larger objects. The result was a spinning disk of gas and dust called a protoplanetary disk.</li>
        <li>Accretion: Over millions of years, the planetesimals within the protoplanetary disk continued to grow through a process called accretion. This process involved the gravitational attraction of solid bodies, causing them to collide and merge.</li>
        <li>Core Formation: In the region of the solar nebula where Neptune eventually formed, the temperature was cold enough for volatile compounds, such as water, ammonia, and methane, to freeze into solid ices. The core of Neptune began to form as planetesimals and dust particles accumulated these ices, along with rock and metal.</li>
        <li>Gas Capture: Once the core reached a critical mass, it had sufficient gravity to attract and capture the surrounding hydrogen and helium gas from the protoplanetary disk. This phase of gas capture was essential for Neptune to become a gas giant.</li>
        <li>Runaway Gas Accretion: As the core continued to grow and accumulate gas, it underwent a period of runaway gas accretion. This phase was relatively rapid on astronomical timescales and led to the formation of Neptune's thick atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Clearing of Surrounding Disk: Neptune's growing mass and gravitational influence eventually cleared out the region of the protoplanetary disk around its orbit. This prevented nearby material from continuing to fall onto the planet.</li>
        <li>Final Configuration: After the gas and dust in the surrounding disk were mostly cleared, Neptune settled into its current orbit and began its long, slow cooling process.</li>
